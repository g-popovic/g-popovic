I'm a full stack developer with over 3 years of professional experience. I began
coding at age 12 and had created several mobile video games by 14. At 17, I
secured a victory in an international hackathon, and I embarked on my career
as a remote developer, gaining extensive experience since then. I’ve also
worked on a variety of real-world applications, personal projects, and
hackathons, as showcased in later sections and on my website..

I specialize in
